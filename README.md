# Overview

This is a simple memory card game that lets you choose your difficulty level and then creates a matching game of Pokémon cards for you to play with. 

I created this game because I wanted to learn more about JavaScript and how to use it to create a game. I decided to create this memory card game because I have a few children that love Pokémon, so I can refresh my JS skills, and they get a new game to play! 

The game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game uses the Pokémon API to get the images and names of the Pokémon. The game uses CSS Grid to create the layout of the game. The game uses JavaScript to create the game logic. The game is hosted on GitHub pages.

# Future Work
- Add a timer to the game.
- Add ability for custom number of cards
- Hide score counter until board is generated
- Replace a pokemon that has a missing image with a different pokemon. The API is pretty good, but some images are missing.
- speed up card transitin animation so the game plays faster
- i put time into the "you win colors and automation, but the initial game board is still the same. I would like to make the game board more dynamic and interesting.
